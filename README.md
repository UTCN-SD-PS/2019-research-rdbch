# FaceDetector

## Short Description

This is the repo of the FaceDetector project that I am curently doing in collaboration with Endava. In this repository one will be able to find the implemented code and the periodically activity report.

## Project status

- [x] Research Period
    - [x] Search the web for best suited object detection algorithm
    - [x] Read about the implementation of algorithms
    - [x] Succesfullt choose one(Single Shot Detector)
    
- [ ] Implementation
    - [x] Make a dummy dataset to better understand the data
    - [x] Implement the neural network
    - [ ] Implement the interpretation graph
    - [ ] Implement the training algorith
    - [ ] Implement visualization 
    - [ ] Experiment on the dummy dataset
    
- [ ] Training 
    - [ ] Find and download a suited face dataset
    - [ ] Start training
    
- [ ] Deploying the model
    - [ ] Optimize the model for inference
    - [ ] Fine-tune the model for desired applications
    - [ ] Make a nice user interface
    
- [ ] Draw conclusion
